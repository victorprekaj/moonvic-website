    <!-- STORY -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Founder Story</h2>
        <p>
            Victor’s journey as a founder began long before MOONVIC existed. Discipline shaped him early — the kind of discipline that comes from building alone, learning fast, and refusing to settle for anything less than excellence. Every skill he carries today was earned through intention, repetition, and an unwavering commitment to growth.
            <br><br>
            When he stepped into Web3, he didn’t see hype — he saw potential. He saw a space where innovation, transparency, and purpose could collide to create something meaningful. MOONVIC was born from that vision: a zero‑tax ecosystem built not for shortcuts, but for longevity, clarity, and real utility.
            <br><br>
            Victor approaches every part of MOONVIC with the same mindset that shaped him: precision over noise, purpose over ego, discipline over chaos. He builds with intention, guided by a sense of divine ambition that pushes him beyond the present moment. To him, MOONVIC isn’t just a project — it’s a future ecosystem crafted with meaning, structure, and a higher purpose.

            <br><br>
            To Victor, discipline is a form of freedom. It creates the space to think clearly, build intelligently, and execute without distraction. Purpose gives direction. Intention gives meaning. Together, they form the foundation of MOONVIC’s identity.
